                        <h3>Are Digital Agencies and Vendors the Real Victims of Extended Payment Terms?</h3>                       
                        <p>While big marketers such as Procter & Gamble, Mondelez and Anheuser-Busch InBev have announced longer payment terms for agencies, adland's been divided over whether it's really a business problem. Now there's some evidence that smaller independent agencies, digital shops and vendors are the ones most likely to wait longer than the standard 30 days. But given it's only been a matter of months since some large international marketers first stated that they'd be pushing payments to four months or more, could the issue really be over?<br />   <br />  
<a style="color: #4d4d4d"href="http://gofastpay.com/research"target="_blank">According to a new study by FastPay</a>&nbsp;focused on the small digital agency and ad-tech landscape, "net 60 is the new norm."</p>

I see it time and time again — businesses put all of their eggs into 1 or 2 customers, neglecting the fact that they can count their revenue sources on one hand. <br />   <br />

                        <h3>7 financial terms every serious entrepreneur should know</h3>                       
                        <p>There are brilliant technologists and business leaders in today’s tech world, but while startups have their own, great talents, we’re seeing one common weakness: lack of understanding elementary financial concepts. Startups forgo hiring a controller to manage the books and create financial reports because of “lean principles.” But even if you aren’t a finance major or don’t employ one, it is every chief executive’s responsibility to understand basic finance principles and how they can affect your business’ bottom line. <br />   <br />  
To help get all you new and hoping-to-be CEOs started on the right financial footing to ensure confidence from your team and your investors, FastPay CEO Jed Simon shares seven basic finance terms that every good entrepreneur knows.</p>

                        <p>Three years ago, AdExchanger covered FastPay, a startup offering credit lines to digital media companies. Since then, FastPay has raised about $35 million in credit and equity itself, expanded its clientele, and is about to launch a new product.  <br />   <br />    
FastPay steps in when an ad network owes money to a publisher but hasn't yet been paid by the advertiser. It fronts money that the network (or other intermediary) can use to pay the publisher while waiting on payments from the ad agency or other buyer.  We caught up with FastPay founder Jed Simon for an update.

                        <p>Building a business around online advertising is hard enough without having to combat the cashflow issues created by lengthy payment terms. A survey by industry regulatory body IAB indicates that nearly 80 percent of digital advertising invoices take 60 days or longer to pay. Yes it’s great that Pepsi and Ford want to advertise on your site, or purchase inventory through your ad exchange, but the fact that they want to pay you “net-90” – or after 90 days – could seriously hamper your growth.  <br />   <br />    
                        	FastPay, a technology-driven “anti-bank” in founder and CEO Jed Simon’s words, is helping combat these growth impediments by providing commercial loans against digital advertising receivables – aka factoring. Since launching in 2010, the company has lent out more than $100 million of this “working capital gap financing” to over 100 publishers, ad-tech companies, and other digital media businesses.

                        <p>When it comes to funding an early-stage company, the options are often limited.  They usually include angel and venture rounds. So it seems reasonable that there should be some more approaches, right?  Well, this is what Jed Simon believes.  Back in 2010, he started FastPay, which allows digital companies to finance their growth from receivables.  Recently I met up with Jed to learn more about his business.

                        <p>Caught in a cash squeeze, emerging media companies are borrowing against their receivables to gain working capital.   <br />   <br />
                           At first, Paras Maniar [founding executive, former chief strategy officer and board member of EQAL]  was cautious about FastPay. “It sounded like a fantasy,” he says. So last year Maniar did a test with one $200,000 invoice. “The cash came right in within 24 hours. When they got payment, they took their piece, and put the rest in our account,” he recalls. Maniar believes that EQAL’s acquisition by Everyday Health was a success  for EQAL in part because it felt it could walk away if the deal wasn’t right. “If you can’t walk away, you get squeezed,” he says.

                        <p>Los Angeles’s rise as an incubator for media-driven technology startups is well-documented, but it’s also becoming a hotbed for innovation in an unexpected vertical: financial services.  With the recent advent of FastPay, a loan company catering to the digital ecosystem, smaller digital players can function more effectively with improved liquidity. Launched in 2010, FastPay grants credit lines (ranging from $100 thousand to $10 million) to lower- and-middle market digital publishers, which accelerate payments and allow firms to do more business.

                        <h3>Is FastPay A Real Alternative To VC Funding? Two Digital Media Startups Say Yes</h3>                       
                        <p>Back in June, I wrote about a startup called FastPay, which offers credit lines to digital media companies. At the time, CEO and founder Jed Simon pitched the service as an 
                        	alternative to venture capital. Well, a couple of months later I asked: Are there really companies that used FastPay instead of raising venture funding?
						In response, the FastPay team put me in touch with two customers — Moguldom Media Group and Giant Media.  <br />   <br />
                      Both Moguldom and Giant have had ongoing relationships with FastPay for the past couple of years. Both companies say they’re profitable, but [Giant Media CEO David] Segura told me that as his company grows, FastPay’s value only increases.

“If you’re growing and things are awesome, the media problem at hand is actually getting worse from the cash flow standpoint,” he said, adding that Fast Pay is doing “in a lot of ways what the banks should be doing.”

                        Concept: Once an ad agency secures a contract from a big name brand, it can take up to 60 days to pay the agency after 
                        a campaign is created and executed. Some of the upfront costs can be in the millions, and agencies get stuck with them for an

                        <h3>FastPay Raises $25M To Tackle Digital Media Cash Flow</h3>
                        <p>FastPay, a startup offering credit lines to digital media companies, says it has raised $25 million in new funding.

That may sound like a weirdly specific business model, but founder and CEO Jed Simon tells me via email that FastPay is solving a big problem in the online advertising industry — the fact that it can take forever to get paid. According to a survey conducted by the Internet Advertising Bureau, it takes 60 days or more to get paid on 80 percent of invoices.

So for example, if you’re a video syndication startup and you win a $2 million ad contract, the advertiser won’t pay you for months, and in the meantime you have to front the money for the campaign. In this situation, the best course of action may be to raise a sizable venture round, but that probably means selling a lot of the company.

                        <p>What FastPay does is interesting: It provides cashflow for online startups that rely on advertising money from big brands, most of which have very long payment cycles. <br /> <br />

When you’re a lean, mean, hungry startup waiting a few months to get your first big check from Nike or Procter &amp; Gamble, having funds when you need them is key — especially if you’re bootstrapped. Since most brands take around two months to pay their online advertising invoices, FastPay steps in with credit lines up to $5 million for a range of online businesses, including web-based publishers, digital creative studios, and ad-tech businesses.

                            The thesis at FastPay is that commercial banks don’t understand the Internet and are therefore reluctant to provide credit to the sector.

                        <h3>4 startups reinventing finance from L.A., not NYC</h3>                       
                        <p>Los Angeles’s rise as an incubator for media-driven technology startups is well-documented, but it’s also becoming a hotbed for innovation in an unexpected vertical: financial services.  With the recent advent of FastPay, a loan company catering to the digital ecosystem, smaller digital players can function more effectively with improved liquidity. Launched in 2010, FastPay grants credit lines (ranging from $100 thousand to $10 million) to lower- and-middle market digital publishers, which accelerate payments and allow firms to do more business. FastPay has provided roughly 100 digital media clients with $100 million in financing and employs twenty people full-time, [CEO Jed Simon] said.

                        <h3>Is FastPay A Real Alternative To VC Funding? Two Digital Media Startups Say Yes</h3>                       
                        <p>Back in June, I wrote about a startup called FastPay, which offers credit lines to digital media companies. At the time, CEO and founder Jed Simon pitched the service as an 
                        	alternative to venture capital. Well, a couple of months later I asked: Are there really companies that used FastPay instead of raising venture funding?
						In response, the FastPay team put me in touch with two customers — Moguldom Media Group and Giant Media.  <br />   <br />
                      Both Moguldom and Giant have had ongoing relationships with FastPay for the past couple of years. Both companies say they’re profitable, but [Giant Media CEO David] Segura told me that as his company grows, FastPay’s value only increases.

“If you’re growing and things are awesome, the media problem at hand is actually getting worse from the cash flow standpoint,” he said, adding that Fast Pay is doing “in a lot of ways what the banks should be doing.”

                        <p>As an entrepreneur, your daily schedule is likely jam-packed with meetings, phone calls and other tasks necessary to keep your business on track. Maximizing productivity is a must, but working straight through your lunch break and

                        <p>FastPay gives ad agencies loans while they're waiting for brands to pay them for executing expensive campaigns.  <br />   <br />
                        Concept: Once an ad agency secures a contract from a big name brand, it can take up to 60 days to pay the agency after 
                        a campaign is created and executed. Some of the upfront costs can be in the millions, and agencies get stuck with them for an 
                        uncomfortably long time. Instead of raising a round or looking towards a bank for help, agencies can secure a line of credit through FastPay.

                        <h3>FastPay Raises $25M To Tackle Digital Media Cash Flow</h3>
                        <p>FastPay, a startup offering credit lines to digital media companies, says it has raised $25 million in new funding.

That may sound like a weirdly specific business model, but founder and CEO Jed Simon tells me via email that FastPay is solving a big problem in the online advertising industry — the fact that it can take forever to get paid. According to a survey conducted by the Internet Advertising Bureau, it takes 60 days or more to get paid on 80 percent of invoices.

So for example, if you’re a video syndication startup and you win a $2 million ad contract, the advertiser won’t pay you for months, and in the meantime you have to front the money for the campaign. In this situation, the best course of action may be to raise a sizable venture round, but that probably means selling a lot of the company.

                        <h3>VentureBeat: FastPay takes money to make money, keeping the lights on for many</h3>
                        <p>What FastPay does is interesting: It provides cashflow for online startups that rely on advertising money from big brands, most of which have very long payment cycles. <br /> <br />

When you’re a lean, mean, hungry startup waiting a few months to get your first big check from Nike or Procter &amp; Gamble, having funds when you need them is key — especially if you’re bootstrapped. Since most brands take around two months to pay their online advertising invoices, FastPay steps in with credit lines up to $5 million for a range of online businesses, including web-based publishers, digital creative studios, and ad-tech businesses.

                        <p>David Segura’s online marketing company was on life support less than a year after launching.When Bank of America rejected his request for a $250,000 loan, Segura had to search 
                        	desperately for a way to pay his vendors while working on viral video campaigns for Sears. In 2010, Segura stumbled upon a Beverly Hills company that was willing to advance $24,000 to 
                        	Giant Media Inc. while holding $30,000 of his invoices as collateral. Within 48 hours, the money was in Segura’s account and Giant Media was able to pay its video producers. 
                        	The company that gave him the money is FastPay.

                        <p>For media companies like web-based publications, financing can often be hard to come by. They’re often ignored by traditional financial organizations, and revenue generating

                        <h3>Destructoid: A Case of Fast Cash</h3>
                        <p>Destructoid is a popular and growing San Francisco-based gaming blog owned by content publisher ModernMethod. The company was founded in 2006 by Yanier Gonzalez, who is also the current CEO. 

Despite the site's success, Destructoid needed to find a way to get revenue and get it fast, since it normally takes advertisers -- its primary source of income -- weeks to pay bills. Gonzalez had no luck when he turned to the banks. <br /> <br />

Without FastPay, Gonzalez doesn't think his business would be thriving the way it is today. "I might've had to sell a kidney; it definitely would not be as awesome as it is today for sure," says Gonzalez. "I sleep better knowing that these guys are in my corner."

                        <p>
                            The thesis at FastPay is that commercial banks don’t understand the Internet and are therefore reluctant to provide credit to the sector.
                            Jamarlin Martin, founder and CEO of Moguldum Media Group, said his African American-focused blog network didn’t need a lot of capital to grow,
                            but the long pay cycles made it difficult to invest in new initiatives. He said FastPay has been a great help. “It’s a nice alternative to have,”
                            Martin said. “Entrepreneurs don’t have to take on the risk of giving up equity just to grow.”
